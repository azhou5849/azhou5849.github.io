\subsection{Challenge problems}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Write down a quadratic with \underline{real} coefficients whose discriminant is a perfect square integer but whose roots are irrational.
\item Write down a quadratic with \underline{complex} coefficients whose discriminant is a negative real number but whose roots are real.
\end{enumerate}
\item Every parabola has a point $F$, called the \emph{focus}, and a line $\ell$, called the \emph{directrix}, with the property that the points $P$ on the parabola are precisely those for which the distance from $P$ to $F$ is the same as the distance from $P$ to $\ell$. The line through $F$ perpendicular to $\ell$ is the axis of symmetry of the parabola.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $F$ be the point $(1,3)$ and let $\ell$ be the line $y = -1$. For the parabola with focus $F$ and directrix $\ell$, what point is the vertex?
\item Find the two points on the line $y = 3$ that lie on the parabola.
\item Write down an equation for the parabola.
\end{enumerate}
\item (Even more challenging than usual) Find all real numbers $x$ for which
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{5 - x} = 5 - x^2.
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

\item In this problem, we are interested in the discriminant $\Delta = 8^2 - 4\cdot 1\cdot c = 64 - 4c$. Note that all coefficients are real.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have two non-real roots if and only if $\Delta < 0$, so
\begin{equation*}
64 - 4c < 0\implies\boxed{c > 16}.
\end{equation*}
\item We have one real root if and only if $\Delta = 0$, so 
\begin{equation*}
64 - 4c = 0\implies\boxed{c = 16}.
\end{equation*}
\item We have two real roots if and only if $\Delta > 0$, so
\begin{equation*}
64 - 4c > 0\implies\boxed{c < 16}.
\end{equation*}
\item All coefficients are integers, so we get two rational roots if and only if $\Delta$ is a positive perfect square. Here we have that $\Delta$ is even and $\Delta < 64$ since $c$ must be a positive integer, so the solutions come from setting
\begin{align*}
64 - 4c = 4 &\implies c = \boxed{15}, \\
64 - 4c = 16 &\implies c = \boxed{12}, \\
64 - 4c = 36 & \implies c = \boxed{7}.
\end{align*}
