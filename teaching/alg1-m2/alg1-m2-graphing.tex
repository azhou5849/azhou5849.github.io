\item the reflection of $A$ across the $y$-axis
\item the reflection of $A$ across the line $y = x$
\item the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)}{rotation} of $A$ around the origin by $180^{\circ}$
\item the rotation of $A$ around the origin by $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise

\end{enumerate}
\item Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is positioned in the coordinate plane so that its vertices have coordinates
\begin{equation*}
A = (5, 7);\quad B = (5, 6);\quad C = (3, 1);\quad D = (-4, -5).
\end{equation*}
Points $E, F, G, H$ are the midpoints of segments $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC}, \overline{CD}, \overline{DA}$, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the coordinates of $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$.
\item Compute the midpoints of segments $\overline{EG}$ and $\overline{FH}$.
\end{enumerate}
To check your work, the two midpoints computed in part (b) should be the same. Doing this calculation in general (rather than with specific numbers) and finding that the midpoints of the diagonals of $EFGH$ coincide proves the following:

\subsection{Challenge}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item (Perpendicular bisector) Given any two points $A$ and $B$, the \emph{perpendicular bisector} of segment $\overline{AB}$ is the line passing through the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ which is perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $B = (14,0)$ and $C = (5,12)$. Find an equation for the perpendicular bisector of segment $\overline{BC}$.
\item Show that for any point $P$ on the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{BC}$, we have $BP = PC$.
\item Conversely, show that if $Q$ is a point in the plane for which $BQ = QC$, then $Q$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{BC}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item (Circumcenter) Given any triangle $ABC$, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of $ABC$ all pass through a single point $O$, called the \emph{circumcenter} of triangle $ABC$. It is the center of the unique circle passing through all three of $A$, $B$, and $C$ (called the \emph{circumcircle} of $ABC$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A = (0,0)$, $B = (14,0)$, and $C = (5,12)$. Find the circumcenter of $ABC$.
\item Find the radius of the circumcircle of $ABC$ (i.e. the \emph{circumradius} of $ABC$).
\end{enumerate}
\item (Median and centroid) Given any triangle $ABC$, the \emph{medians} are the lines that pass through one vertex and the midpoint of the side opposite that vertex. For example, the $A$-median is the line that passes through $A$ and the midpoint of side $\overline{BC}$. The three medians of a triangle all pass through a single point $G$, called the \emph{centroid} of triangle $ABC$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A = (0,0)$, $B = (14,0)$, and $C = (5,12)$. Let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the midpoints of sides $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$, and $\overline{AB}$, respectively. Find the coordinates of $D$, $E$, and $F$.
\item Find the coordinates of the centroid $G$ of $ABC$. How do they relate to the coordinates of $A$, $B$, and $C$?
\item Compute the ratios $AG/GD$, $BG/GE$, and $CG/GF$.
\end{enumerate}
\item (Altitude and orthocenter) Given any triangle $ABC$, the \emph{altitudes} are the lines that pass through one vertex which are perpendicular to the opposite side. For example, the $A$-altitude is the line that passes through $A$ and is perpendicular to line $\overline{BC}$. The three altitudes of a triangle all pass through a single point $H$, called the \emph{orthocenter} of triangle $ABC$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A = (0,0)$, $B = (14,0)$, and $C = (5,12)$. Find equations for the altitudes of $ABC$.
\item Find the coordinates of the orthocenter $H$ of $ABC$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Let $A = (1,1)$, $B = (5,2)$, and $C = (-4,3)$. There are three parallelograms in the plane for which $A$, $B$, and $C$ are three of the four vertices. What are the possible coordinates for the fourth vertex?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Answers}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In your drawing, the origin should be at $(0,0)$, where the coordinate axes intersect. Quadrant I is in the upper right, quadrant II is in the upper left, quadrant III is in the lower left, and quadrant IV is in the lower right.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $(3,-1)$
\item $(-3,1)$
\item $(1,3)$
\item $(-3,-1)$
\item $(-1,3)$
\item $(1,1)$
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $E = (5, 13/2)$; $F = (4, 7/2)$; $G = (-1/2, -2)$; $H = (1/2,1)$
\item The midpoint of $\overline{EG}$ is $(9/4, 9/4)$, which is also the midpoint of $\overline{FH}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $\boxed{17}$
\item $5 + 13 + 10 + 1 = \boxed{29}$
\end{enumerate}
\item The second and third expressions are valid.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The slope is $\boxed{1/4}$, and one of the points on the line is $\boxed{(-1,4)}$.
\item Distributing the right hand side gives us 
\begin{equation*}
y - 4 = \frac{1}{4}x + \frac{1}{4}.
\end{equation*}
Adding 4 to both sides gives us the slope-intercept form
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{y = \frac{1}{4}x + \frac{17}{4}}.
\end{equation*}
The $y$-intercept is $\boxed{(0, 17/4)}$.
\item Subtracting $y$ from both sides, then subtracting $17/4$ from both sides,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{4}x - y = -\frac{17}{4}.
\end{equation*}
To clear denominators, we multiply both sides by $4$ to get the standard form 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{x - 4y = -17}.
\end{equation*}
When $y = 0$, we have $x = -17$, so the $x$-intercept is $\boxed{(-17, 0)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The blue line passes through $(0, 3.5)$, which only satisfies the equation $\boxed{x - 2y = -7}$.
\item The first and last equation describe lines, so the answer cannot be those. Of the remaining two equations, the point $(7,0)$ on the red curve only satisfies $\boxed{x^2 + xy + y^2 = 49}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item The slope is $\boxed{-1/4}$ and the $y$-intercept is $\boxed{(0,-3)}$.
\item To get standard form, we start by moving all of the variables to one side so that $x$ has a positive coefficient and moving all of the constants to the other. Adding $\frac{1}{4}x$ to both sides gives us 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{4}x + y = -3.
\end{equation*}
Multiplying both sides by $4$ gives the standard form 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{x + 4y = -12}.
\end{equation*}
To get the $x$-intercept, we plug in $y = 0$ to get $x = -12$, so the $x$-intercept is $\boxed{(-12,0)}$.
\item Substituting $x = 2024$ into the slope-intercept form given to us,
\begin{equation*}
y = \left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)\cdot 2024 - 3 = -509.
\end{equation*}
The point-slope form with slope $-1/4$ and point $(2024, -509)$ is
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{y + 509 = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 2024)}.
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Letting $x = 0$, the $y$-intercept is $\boxed{(0, -4)}$.\par
Letting $y = 0$, the $x$-intercept is $\boxed{(-4/3, 0)}$.
\item Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$, the slope-intercept form is 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{y = -3x - 4}.
\end{equation*}
The slope of the line is $\boxed{-3}$.
\item We want the point $(x,y)$ to lie on the line, i.e. to satisfy $3x + y = -4$, and to have sum of coordinates 10, i.e. $x + y = 10$. Solving the system of equations, $(x,y) = \boxed{(-7,17)}$. The desired point-slope form is then
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{y - 17 = -3(x + 7)}.
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $y - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(x + 5)$
\item Slope-intercept form: $y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{9}{2}$\par
Standard form: $x - 2y = -9$
\end{enumerate}
\item The line through the two points is the vertical line $\boxed{x = -3}$.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $\dfrac{3 - (-4)}{(-3) - 0} = \boxed{-\frac{7}{3}}$
\item Using $(-3,3)$, we get $\boxed{y - 3 = -\frac{7}{3}(x + 3)}$.\par 
Using $(0, -4)$, we get $\boxed{y + 4 = -\frac{7}{3}(x - 0)}$.
\item Slope-intercept form: $\boxed{y = -\frac{7}{3}x - 4}$\par 
Standard form: $\boxed{7x + 3y = -12}$
\end{enumerate}
\item Substituting the two given points, we get the system of equations
\begin{equation*}
5m + b = 7\qquad\text{and}\qquad 8m + b = -1.
\end{equation*}
Solving yields $\boxed{(m,b) = \left(-\frac{8}{3}, \frac{61}{3}\right)}$.
\item The point of intersection is given by the solution to the system of equations
\begin{align*}
2023x + 2022y &= 2021, \tag{1} \\
2024x + 2023y &= 2022. \tag{2}
\end{align*}
Taking the difference of equations $(2) - (1)$ gives us 
\begin{equation*}
x + y = 1 \tag{3}.
\end{equation*}
Then, $(1) - 2022\cdot (3)$ gives us $x = -1$. Substituting back into $(3)$ gives us $y = 2$, so the point of intersection is $\boxed{(-1,2)}$.
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Given a line with slope $m\neq 0$, the slope of any line perpendicular to it is given by $-1/m$. Applying this formula with $m = -4$, the slope of $\ell$, tells us the slope of $\ell'$ must be $\boxed{1/4}$.
\item Using point-slope form, since $\ell'$ passes through $P$, one equation for $\ell'$ is 
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{y - 2 = \frac{1}{4}(x + 4)}.
\end{equation*}
\item Solving the system of equations
\begin{equation*}
y = -4x - 2\qquad\text{and}\qquad y - 2 = \frac{1}{4}(x + 4),
\end{equation*}
we find that $Q = \boxed{(-20/17, 46/17)}$.
\end{enumerate}
