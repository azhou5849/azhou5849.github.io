\section{Linear Inequalities}

\subsection{Review problems}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve each of the following inequalities, expressing the solution set in interval notation and graphing the solution set on a number line.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x > -1$
\item $2x + 5\leq 7$
\item $7 - 3x < 5x - 9$
\item $(x + 4)^2 + x^2\geq (x + 2)^2 + (x + 1)^2$
\end{enumerate}
\item For each of the following combinations of inequalities, write the solution set in interval notation and graph the solution set on a number line.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $2\leq 3 + x < 6$
\item $x\geq 2 - x$ or $5 - 3x\geq x + 9$
\item $-9x + 4 < 8x + 2 < 2x + 7$
\item $-6x - 8\leq 4$ and $-x - 10\leq -7$
\item $-6x - 8\leq 4$ or $-x - 10\leq -7$
\end{enumerate}
\emph{In mathematics, the convention in almost all scenarios is that ``or'' is inclusive: when we join two separate statements with an ``or,'' the combined statement is true when at least one of the original statements is true. For example, ``$x > 1$ or $x > 2$'' is true when $x = 3$.}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Write down a pair of linear inequalities for which no real number satisfies both of the inequalities simultaneously. In this case, the solution set for ``[first inequality] and [second inequality]'' is the \emph{empty set}, denoted $\emptyset$.
\item Write down a pair of linear inequalities for which every real number satisfies at least one of the inequalities. In this case, the solution set for ``[first inequality] or [second inequality]'' is the entire set of real numbers, denoted $\mathbb{R}$. We could also write $(-\infty, \infty)$.
\item Write down a pair of linear inequality for which the only real number which does not satisfy at least one of the inequalities is $6.626$. Express this solution set in interval notation as a union ($\cup$) of two intervals.
\end{enumerate}
\item % absolute value
\item % standard two-variable inequalities (single)
\item % standard two-variable inequalities (system)
\item % two-variable inequalities (target region of plane)
\end{enumerate}
